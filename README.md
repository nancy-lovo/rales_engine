# README

#### Brief Description
- This project contains a JSON API that exposes the data schema (i.e., record endpoints, relationship endpoints, and business intelligence queries).
- Endpoints are namespaced to organize the code effectively; that is, to follow the Object Oriented design patterns. As a result, each endpoint follows RESTful conventions and is limited to specific controller actions. Such namespacing allows version control to be easily maintained.
- Original data was imported from e-commerce-related CSV files from the [sales engine repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/sales_engine/tree/master/data).

#### Setup
- Ruby version: `ruby 2.6.3p62`
